				<h3>Flights & Transportation</h3>
				<p>
				We are recommending that anyone flying in from overseas arrive on Thursday, November 7th, 2013 - the day before our wedding - to JFK airport.
				There are 3 non-stop flights a day from Dublin to JFK Airport, 
				two with <a href="http://www.aerlingus.com/travelinformation/weboffersfromireland/irelandtotheusa/" target="_blank">Aer Lingus</a>, morning and afternoon,
				and one <a href="http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/shop/deals-and-offers/europe/ireland-flights.html" target="_blank">Delta</a> (codeshared with <a href="http://www.klm.com/travel/ie_en/plan_and_book/booking/book_a_flight/index.htm?destination=JFK&dest=JFK&inttype=offer.JFK&c[0].os=DUB&c[0].ds=JFK" target="_blank">KLM</a>) in the morning. 
				You can find various flight options by visiting <a href="http://www.expedia.ie/Flights-Search?trip=roundtrip&leg1=from:Dublin,%20Ireland%20(DUB),to:New%20York,%20NY,%20United%20States%20(JFK-John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Intl.),departure:07%2F11%2F2013TANYT&leg2=from:New%20York,%20NY,%20United%20States%20(JFK-John%20F.%20Kennedy%20Intl.),to:Dublin,%20Ireland%20(DUB),departure:14%2F11%2F2013TANYT&passengers=children:0,adults:2,seniors:0,infantinlap:Y&options=cabinclass:economy,maxhops:0,nopenalty:N,sortby:price&mode=search" target="_blank">expedia.ie</a>

				JFK airport is approximately 40 minutes away from the <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/J/JFKMLGI-ARW-20131107/index.jhtml" target="_blank">Hilton Garden Inn Melville</a>,

				<h3>ESTA and the Visa Waiver Program </h3>
				<p>
				All guests travelling from Europe to the US need to have a Visa Waiver and must apply for an ESTA. 
				This application is now mandatory and must be <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/" target="_blank">completed online</a> at least 72 hours in advance of your journey by EACH person traveling. 
				Once completed your ESTA is valid for all travel to the US from two years from the date of authorization, or until your passport expires, whichever comes first.
				The cost of appling is $14 per person and you can pay by MasterCard, VISA, American Express, and Discover (Laser is not accepted). 
				You will need your flight number and passport as well as the address of where you will spend your first night.
				If you are staying at multiple hotels throughout your trip you only need to provide your first hotels address on all US paperwork.
				You can apply for a <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/" target="_blank">ESTA online here</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Accomodation</h3>
				<p>
				We have selected the <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/J/JFKMLGI-ARW-20131107/index.jhtml" target="_blank">Hilton Garden Inn Melville</a> 
				as it is about 30 minutes to the church, and only 10 minutes away from our reception venue.  
				We have put aside a block of rooms for a special rate of <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/J/JFKMLGI-ARW-20131107/index.jhtml" target="_blank">$129 + tax</a>
				(room rate only) for the nights of Thursday the 7th and Friday the 8th of November.
				You have a choice of a room with a king-sized bed or 2 queen beds.  
				There are also a limited number of suites available. 
				All rooms are equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron and ironing board 
				and complimentary high speed internet access (Ciaran wouldn't have it any other way!).  
				The hotel also has a indoor pool, jacuzzi, and gym for those of you looking for a last minute workout. 
				You can book a room by calling +1-516-755-5552  and quoting "group rate ARW" or online by visiting <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/J/JFKMLGI-ARW-20131107/index.jhtml" target="_blank">hiltongardeninn.hilton.com</a>.
				</p>
				<h3>Shuttle Service</h3>
				<p>
				<!--We will be providing shuttle transportation to and from the hotel to the church and back again for those of you who haven't rented cars. 
				The shuttle will be leaving the hotel one hour prior to the church starting time, 
				and be returning to the hotel after the wedding ceremony is over.  
				It would be most helpful if you could visit the RSVP page and let us know if you will be using our shuttle, 
				or getting to and from the church on your own.-->
				We will be providing shuttle transportation from the hotel to the reception at <a href="http://woodlandsatwoodbury.com/" target="_blank">The Woodlands</a> 
				and afterwards to bring us back to the hotel, where we can keep the party going into the wee hours at the hotel bar.
