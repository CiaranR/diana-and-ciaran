				JFK airport is approximately 40 minutes away from the <a href="http://hiltongardeninn.hilton.com/en/gi/groups/personalized/J/JFKMLGI-ARW-20131107/index.jhtml" target="_blank">Hilton Garden Inn Melville</a>,

				There is complimentary parking available at the recommended hotel.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Alternatively, you can arrange for a car service to pick you up, it will take approximately 40 minutes from the airport to the hotel.
				Depending on the size of your party, a larger shuttle van might make sense. 
				<!--Below are some companies that you can contact to arrange transportation.-->
				</p>
				<h3>ESTA and the Visa Waiver Program </h3>
				<p>
				All guests travelling from Europe to the US need to have a Visa Waiver and must apply for an ESTA. 
				This application is now mandatory and must be <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/" target="_blank">completed online</a> at least 72 hours in advance of your journey by EACH person traveling. 
				Once completed your ESTA is valid for all travel to the US from two years from the date of authorization, or until your passport expires, whichever comes first.
				The cost of appling is $14 per person and you can pay by MasterCard, VISA, American Express, and Discover (Laser is not accepted). 
				You will need your flight number and passport as well as the address of where you will spend your first night.
				If you are staying at multiple hotels throughout your trip you only need to provide your first hotels address on all US paperwork.
				You can apply for a <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/" target="_blank">ESTA online here</a>.
				</p>

				There are also a limited number of suites available. 
				All rooms are equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron and ironing board

				<h3>Shuttle Service</h3>
				<p>
				<!--We will be providing shuttle transportation to and from the hotel to the church and back again for those of you who haven't rented cars. 
				The shuttle will be leaving the hotel one hour prior to the church starting time, 
				and be returning to the hotel after the wedding ceremony is over.  
				It would be most helpful if you could visit the RSVP page and let us know if you will be using our shuttle, 
				or getting to and from the church on your own.-->
				We will be providing shuttle transportation from the hotel to the reception at <a href="http://woodlandsatwoodbury.com/" target="_blank">The Woodlands</a>
