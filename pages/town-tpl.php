				We are very excited that so many of you will be coming from far and wide to join us on our special day.  
				We hope this page helps you plan your trip, if there are any other details you need, 
				please don't hesitate to get in touch with us by emailing contact@diana-and-ciaran.com.
				We are happy for you to decide what works for you best, 
				but below you will find our recommendations to help make your trip easy to plan.
				</p>

				<h3>Flights & Transportation</h3>
				<p>
				We are recommending that anyone flying in from overseas arrive on Thursday, November 7th, 2013 - the day before our wedding.
				There are 3 non-stop flights a day from Dublin to JFK Airport with Aer Lingus, Delta, or United Airways.
				You can find various flight options by visiting kayak.co.uk
				</p>
				<p>
				JFK airport is approximately 40 minutes away from the Hilton Garden Inn Melville, our recommended hotel.
				If you are choosing to rent a car, you will find all major car rental companies are located in JFK airport.
				You can find driving directions from the airport to the hotel here (http://hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com/en/hotels/new-york/hilton-garden-inn-melville-JFKMLGI/maps-directions/index.html).
				There is complimentary parking available at the recommended hotel.  
				</p>
				<p>
				Alternatively, you can arrange for a car service to pick you up, it will take approximately 30-40 minutes from the airport to the hotel.
				Depending on the size of your party, a larger shuttle van might make sense. 
				Below are some companies that you can contact to arrange transportation.
				</p>
				<h3>Accomodation</h3>
				<p>
				We have selected the Hilton Garden Inn Melville as it is about 30 minutes to the church, and only 10 minutes away from our reception venue.  
				We have put aside a block of rooms for a rate of $129.00 per night.  
				You have a choice of a room with a king-sized bed or 2 queen beds.  
				There are also a limited number of suites available. 
				All rooms are equipped with a refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, iron and ironing board 
				and complimentary high speed internet access (Ciaran wouldn't have it any other way!).  
				The hotel also has a indoor pool, jacuzzi, and gym for those of you looking for a last minute workout. 
				You can book a room by calling xxx-xxx-xxxx or online by visiting www.hilton.com/altmann.
				</p>
				<h3>Shuttle Service</h3>
				<p>
				We will be providing shuttle transportation to and from the hotel to the church and back again for those of you who haven't rented cars. 
				The shuttle will be leaving the hotel one hour prior to the church starting time, 
				and be returning to the hotel after the wedding ceremony is over.  
				It would be most helpful if you could visit the RSVP page and let us know if you will be using our shuttle, 
				or getting to and from the church on your own.
				</p>
				<p>
				We will be providing shuttle transportation again for the reception.  
				The shuttle will do two trips, leaving the hotel at 6:40pm and again at 7:00pm to arrive for cocktail hour, 
				and leaving The Woodlands at 11:45 and 12:00am to bring us back to the Hilton Garden Inn Melville, 
				where we can keep the party going into the wee hours at the hotel bar.
